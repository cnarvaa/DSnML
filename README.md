# DSnML
In this repo, I will load some of the assignments from two Data Science courses. The first one is the [Open Machine Learning Course](https://mlcourse.ai) and the other is the [AcÃ¡mica](https://www.acamica.com/data-science) course.

The idea is to have different folders for each step on the DS pipeline.
Data Analysis and Exploration-> Modeling -> Deploying

The idea of finishing this course is the become a Machine Learning Engineer who is capable of understanding models closely and implementing feasible solutions.

# Let's see how it goes!
